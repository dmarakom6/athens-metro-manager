RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS FOR ATHENS METRO MANAGER
=============================================

PREREQUISITES
-------------
This project uses the Simple Graphics Library (SGG).
You need a C++ compiler (g++ or clang++) and Make installed.

1. LINUX
--------
Try running this in terminal:
  g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra     -I. -I../sgg -I/usr/include/jsoncpp     main.cpp -o athens-metro-manager  \
  -L../sgg/lib -lsgg -lSDL2 -lSDL2_mixer -lfreetype -ljsoncpp -lGL -lGLEW

else:

Dependencies:
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev libglew-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libfreetype6-dev

Build and Run:
  make clean
  make run

2. MACOS (Intel)
----------------
Dependencies (using Homebrew):
  brew install sdl2 sdl2_mixer glew freetype

Build and Run:
  make clean
  make run

3. MACOS (Apple Silicon / M1 / M2 / M3)
---------------------------------------
Note: The SGG library and dependencies might be installed for x86_64 architecture.
If you encounter architecture mismatch errors (arm64 vs x86_64), you should run everything in x86_64 mode using Rosetta.

Dependencies (using x86_64 Homebrew):
  arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew install sdl2 sdl2_mixer glew freetype

Build and Run:
  make clean
  arch -x86_64 make
  arch -x86_64 ./athens-metro-manager

4. WINDOWS
----------
The project is best developed on Linux or macOS.
For Windows, you would need to:
1. Install MinGW-w64
2. Ensure all dependencies (SDL2, GLEW, etc.) are available in the library path
3. Use the provided Makefile (you might need to adjust paths manually)

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- "ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64":
  This means you are trying to link x86_64 libraries on an ARM64 machine without specifying the architecture.
  Use `arch -x86_64 make` instead of just `make`.

- "fatal error: 'sgg/graphics.h' file not found":
  Ensure the SGG library is located in the parent directory (`../sgg`) or update the `SGG_DIR` variable in the Makefile.
